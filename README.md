How to navigate.

Setting Up and Starting the Vite React Application
Open Terminal:
Open your terminal application.
cd path-to-your-cloned-repository
Install Dependencies:
Install the necessary npm packages using npm install.

```
npm install
```

Start the Vite React App:
Start the development server using the npm run dev command.

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, typically on http://localhost:3000.

Setting Up and Starting the Express Application
Navigate to the Server Directory:

```
cd server
```

Install Server Dependencies:
Just like with the React app, install the npm packages required for your server.

```
npm install
```

Start the Express Server:
Start the server, which is often done with npm start, though it may vary depending on the scripts defined in your package.json.

```
npm start
```
